# Bonfire Loop Runbook

The loop exists to build the Bonfire demo in small, verified slices. It may
create worktrees, make changes, run checks, push branches, and open draft PRs.
It may not merge.

## Modes

### 1. Manual

Use this until the first end-to-end slice has passed.

```bash
scripts/loop/create-worktree.sh harness-smoke
scripts/loop/ledger.mjs add --key harness-001 --source manual --sev med \
  --title "Harness smoke" --action "Run verifier on the harness skeleton"
```

### 2. Semi-auto

Default once one manual slice works.

1. Run `scripts/loop/task.mjs next`.
2. Run `scripts/loop/task.mjs contract BF-XX` and paste that contract into the
   maker prompt.
3. Mark the task active:
   `scripts/loop/task.mjs status BF-XX active --branch loop/BF-XX`.
4. Create a worktree with `scripts/loop/create-worktree.sh BF-XX`.
5. Run a maker agent against the slice contract.
6. Run the task's verify commands, then `scripts/loop/verify.sh` once scaffold
   exists.
7. Run the Bonfire verifier agent.
8. Run the security auditor when the slice touches data, authz, audit, FHIR,
   MCP, logging, or hosted playground code.
9. Open a draft PR.
10. Iterate on CI, verifier findings, security findings, and Greptile until
   Greptile reports `5/5`.
11. Mark the task `passed` only after human review confirms the PR is merged or
    intentionally accepted.

### 3. Scheduled Triage

Allowed only for discovery. A scheduled loop may update the inbox but may not
implement without an explicit human-triggered slice contract.

## Slice Order

The canonical slice order lives in `docs/loop/tasks.json`. For a human-readable
view, read `docs/loop/TASKS.md` or run:

```bash
scripts/loop/task.mjs list
```

Do not skip ahead unless the skipped task is explicitly marked `blocked` in
`task-status.json` with a note explaining why.

## Session Start Checklist

Every maker/checker session starts with:

```bash
pwd
git log --oneline -5
scripts/loop/task.mjs validate
scripts/loop/task.mjs list
scripts/loop/task.mjs next
```

Then read only the relevant task contract and impacted files. Keep context
small; avoid loading the entire repo into the model.

For long autonomous runs, apply `docs/loop/AUTONOMY.md` before starting the
maker agent. It documents the Codex/Claude Code permissions that prevent routine
Bun, Docker, GitHub, and localhost smoke checks from turning into repeated
approval stops.

## Failure Triage

Do not patch CI failures blindly. First classify the failure:

- Deterministic failures, such as syntax, typecheck, lint, unit tests, Docker
  build, or API smoke, require root-cause investigation and a targeted fix.
- Eventual failures, such as reviewer output not being available yet or service
  health races, require bounded polling/retry plus diagnostics.
- Blocked failures, such as missing credentials, missing reviewer app
  installation, forbidden file scope, or two repeated failures of the same
  command, require a clear stop report.

Harness changes are allowed when they are tied to a concrete failure and add
one of: a local verifier check, a bounded retry, or a runbook entry for the
human action.

After every push to an open PR, watch CI instead of waiting manually:

```bash
node scripts/loop/ci-watch.mjs --repo ticvision/bonfire-db --pr 1 --wait-seconds 1800 --poll-seconds 30
```

If a check fails, the watcher prints the failed check names, job links, and
relevant GitHub Actions log lines. Treat that output as the next investigation
input, fix the root cause, push, and rerun the watcher until all checks pass or
a stop condition applies.

## External Reviewer Gates

Greptile is asynchronous. The loop gate must wait for review output before
failing for absence, but it must still fail immediately when a visible Greptile
score is below `5/5`.

Draft PRs skip the Greptile gate. Marking the PR ready for review triggers the
strict Greptile `5/5` gate.

The fallback parser checks PR comments, PR reviews, and check runs on both the
workflow event SHA and the PR head SHA:

```bash
node scripts/loop/greptile-gate.mjs --trigger --wait-seconds 900 --poll-seconds 30
```

Configure one Greptile trigger path when Greptile exposes it:

- Default comment trigger: `--trigger` posts `@greptileai` once per head SHA.
- URL trigger: set `GREPTILE_TRIGGER_URL` and optional
  `GREPTILE_TRIGGER_TOKEN`; this does not also post the default comment.
- Comment trigger override: set `GREPTILE_TRIGGER_COMMENT` to a more specific
  bot command. The harness posts it once per head SHA.

When a Greptile summary says which commit it reviewed, the gate rejects stale
summaries that do not match the current PR head or merge SHA.

Harness-authored trigger comments are marked and ignored as review output, so
`@greptileai` trigger comments cannot mask a missing scored Greptile summary.

CI attempts the configured trigger before polling. Set
`GREPTILE_TRIGGER_REQUIRED=true` only when a real trigger URL, trigger token, or
comment-capable token is configured; otherwise the gate should continue polling
for normal Greptile app output after a trigger failure.

If the organization blocks write permissions for the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, set
`GREPTILE_GH_TOKEN` to a fine-grained token that can read pull requests/checks
and write PR comments for this repository. The workflow uses that secret when it
exists and falls back to `github.token` otherwise.

If no Greptile output is visible after the wait, treat it as a blocked external
review setup problem, not a BF task implementation failure.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report instead of continuing when:

- The same verifier finding fails twice.
- `MAX ATTEMPTS`, `MAX TURNS`, or `MAX BUDGET USD` is reached.
- The task needs a product decision not covered by the slice contract.
- A security auditor returns `BLOCKING`.
- Greptile cannot be read from GitHub after the configured wait window.
- A task requires files outside its `allowedPaths`; stop and update the task
  contract in a separate harness PR.

## Merge Contract

Merge is allowed only after:

- CI green.
- `scripts/loop/verify.sh` green.
- Bonfire verifier: `PASS`.
- Security auditor: `CLEAR` when applicable.
- Greptile: `5/5`.
- Human final review complete.
